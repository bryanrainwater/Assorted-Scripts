### PENDING CHANGES LIST ###

COMPLETE * Need to add blank list for raw input output list to front panel...
	COMPLETE * Potentially add header to raw input/output list
		NOTE: Header only added for left side, consider removing output list
COMPLETE * Duplicate second plot changes to the first plot...
COMPLETE * Improve color schemes on plots and modify font sizes...
COMPLETE * Expand instructional interface on front panel...
COMPLETE Add full interfacing of Auxiliary device configurations...

COMPLETE * Create Error Status Indicator on Front panel (IN RED) appended to instructional list.
COMPLETE * Add Error code blocks to populate Error Status Indicator on Front Panel
COMPLETE * Populate error code array and disperse to various exception blocks
COMPLETE * Reimplement linux variant with the aforementioned updates.
	Linux Variant Requires:
		self.basedir = os.path.expanduser('~/CVI/')	 #Full path required; however, os.path.expanduser will allow use of ~
COMPLETE * Change Defaults file for linux path '~/CVI/'
COMPLETE * Rectify Issue with counterflow reduction overshooting.
COMPLETE * Provide error instructions for if any files are not found.
COMPLETE * Identify issue with segmentation faults occuring in linux and NOT windows

UNECESSARY * Allow realtime updating for reading calibration coefficients from tables
COMPLETE * Add delete button for deleting certain coefficients
COMPLETE * Add update button to reread calibrations from files
COMPLETE * Add ability to prevent rapid updates to text entry fields so that a . is not read, etc. (check if field is being entered?)
COMPLETE * Remove DSM Header printout to terminal
UNECESSARY * Add wrap text and scrollable to dsm header box.
* Verify why flow can be "off" and yet the user input voltages will still output.
COMPLETE * Correct raw input/output indicator updating (and labeling)
COMPLETE * Correct Display scaling for program
COMPLETE * Verify that when instrument add routine is cancelled, valves are reverted and things are reversed.
COMPLETE * Add sliders to everything!!!
* Add counterflow excess increase button for just in case moments
* Allow cvfx0, cvfx2, cvfx3, cvfx4 to independently increased while allowing other flows to compensate.
	cvfx0 would compensate for any changes to the other ones (autopilot button?)
COMPLETE * Grey out the connect and disconnect buttons after the connect button is pressed.
COMPLETE * Add checklist that pops up upon request that allows you to set a data folder prefix for flight, etc.

COMPLETE * Correct NIDAS header output....
* Correct text entry fields (manVolt) to be editingFinished...

* Repair calibration coefficients dynamic array growth (currently capped at 20 versions)

Miscellaneous Updates
* Added exception handling for full feedback loop. Try to perform calculation, exception prints out raw data stream to terminal.

ARISTO Updates
* Fix input/output raw list for relabeling....
* The common notes button is a little too close for comfort (accidentally hit)
* The start and stop button is too close to the cvi mode button
COMPLETE * Fix the lower time series sizing

COMPLETE * Creat shortcut on desktop for CVI folder
COMPLETE * Adjust TDL calibration coefficients to older values
	-0.2	1.33676	-0.03415	0.00145
COMPLETE * Add seconds from midnight to notes and error logs (remove date?)

PARTIAL * Core dump after start is pressed in double succession (Address was already allocated)

* Various cosmetic changes

* Put Stop button in upper right corner if possible, currently too close to comment window. Would be bad to accidentally hit it in turbulence
COMPLETE * You can't read start file name at all when it's bright as it was yesterday and tends to be at high altitude.
* Time series: * Need to type in Manual Yaxis setpoints as we've discussed
	COMPLETE * Remove Y2 scale when not being used to avoid confusion
	VOID (cals are 1:1) * CVFX5R and CVFX5C seem to be the same
	COMPLETE * Change light blue to bright green or something more prominent. 
COMPLETE * Default start values: Time series start with rhoo_tdl on top and cvcnco1 on bottom.
COMPLETE * cvf3c at 0.3, cvfx0c at 2.0.
COMPLETE (Changed to "CF_Excess") * Can you make CVf3C setting more prominent, and/or move it to top, and label it "cntrflow"?
COMPLETE (appended _CVI.dat) * Think it's time to change the data file name from nn.nnq to nn.nvCVI.dat or nn.nvCVI.txt
COMPLETE * User Notes to add: Taxi, Takeoff, Heaters ON, Landed

* Change units corresponding to ['H2O','ptdl','ttdl','cvf3','cvcnc1','cvcnc01','cvrho_tdl',
              'cvrhoo_tdl','opcc','opcco','cvfx5R','cvfx5c','cvts','cvtai','cvcfact'
	to  [g m-3, mb, C, vlpm (or slpm?), # cm-3, # cm-3, g m-3, g m-3, # cm-3, # cm-3, slpm, vlpm, C, C, unitless]

* Look into the rollover values for TDL (do we want it to send an error message whenever data is lost and then regained, but not every second?)


* Begin writing TDL calibration automation routine.
	Will need to write real flow to cvfx2wr, while reading cvfx2 and all of the H2O return parameters
	Will need to write cvfx3wr for dew point generator and read the return.
	Choices:
		Comma delimited steps field
		Minimum time between steps before checking for stability. (Maximum time before moving on?.... timeout)
	Plot the return signals as it goes
	Create a plot for the setpoint mixing ratio with the returned mixing ratio.
	Second plot for the returned tdl mixing ratio
	Create tab delimited save file with all of the above data.
	Implementation:
		Create the various widgets
		Start and Cancel button (cancel greyed until started, and start greyed once started.)
		Once start is pressed, all other tabs locked, flow turned on, cvfx2 set to what is on new screen.
		Once flow return has settled, begin set point ramps and grey out everything except cancel.
		Add check in processData for if TDL cals occuring, emit signal each time data comes
			in for plotting, saving, analyzing, etc.
	Unsure of how to handle cvfx3 so it can be seen using raw voltage.
		
		
		
		
* There is a potentially LARGE issue that if the client is severed forcibly, it may crash the python code.
